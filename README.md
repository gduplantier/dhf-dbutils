## Project Description
This project includes a buildSrc folder that implements custom Gradle Tasks. These tasks are extended in the build.gradle file. You can update the tasks in the build.gradle file to include different parameters if needed, i.e., output file/directory.

## JDBC Drivers
This project requires Oracle and/or DB2 JDBC drivers.  You can download these from the respective websites.  You'll need to add them to buildSrc/libs (Create folder if it doesn't exist)

## Extending
The patterns and some of the code in the implementation should work with other Databases and Drivers. There is lots of room to make the code more generic and support other Databases.
